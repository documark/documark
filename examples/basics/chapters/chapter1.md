# Welcome to Documark

You're in! Nice. We've put together a little example document to introduce you to Documark and get you started. Go ahead and edit this document to get going and learn how it all works!

## Getting Started

Writing in markdown is really easy. Where appropriate, you can use _formatting_ shortcuts to style __your content__. For example, a list:

- Item number one
- Item number two
    - A nested item
- A final item

or with numbers!

1. Remember to buy some milk
2. Drink the milk
3. Tweet that I remembered to buy the milk, and drank it

### Links

Want to link to a source? No problem. If you paste in url, like http://google.nl - it'll automatically be linked up. But if you want to customize your anchor text, you can do that too! Here's a link to [Google.nl](http://google.nl). Neat.

### What about images?

Images work too! You can add them like this:

![Image Example](/assets/img/Markdown.png)

External images? No problem!

![Placeholder](http://placehold.it/350x150)

### Ready for a Break?

Throw 3 or more dashes down on any new line and you've got yourself a fancy new divider. Aw yeah.

Or maybe a forced page break?

<div style="page-break-after:always"></div>

Done.

### Quoting

Sometimes a link isn't enough, you want to quote someone on what they've said. It was probably very wisdomous. Is wisdomous a word? Find out in a future release when we introduce spellcheck! For now - it's definitely a word.

> Wisdomous - it's definitely a word.

> -- Some guy

### Working with Code

Got a streak of geek? We've got you covered there, too. You can write inline `<code>` blocks really easily with back ticks. Want to show off something more comprehensive? 4 spaces or a tab of indentation get you there:

    .awesome-thing {
        display: block;
        width: 100%;
    }

### Advanced Usage

There's one fantastic secret about Markdown. If you want, you can write plain old HTML and it'll still work! Very flexible.

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>A</th>
            <th>B</th>
            <th>C</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>One</td>
            <td>Two</td>
            <td>Three</th>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

That should be enough to get you started. Have fun - and let us know what you think :)
